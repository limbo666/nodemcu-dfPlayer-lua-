dfPlayer mini control by lua 
===================================
Control dfPlayer mini devices from nodemcu (firmware) based devices using their serial communication protocol.
dfPlayer mini is a low cost mp3 player which can be used in many appliactions. *Secifications about the hardware can be found on https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU:DFR0299 *
The lack of standarized support on nodemcu was the motivation to create a simple file which send control commands to the device and can be re-used in any application.
This code helps developers to integrate mp3 modules easily to any project is needed.

**Important notice: dfPlayer serial communication is set by default to 9600 baud and according to DF player there is no commnds to allow change the communication speed. So nodemcu module (ESP, Wemos) should set its UART to 9600 as well**
Running a UART setup command is essential step to communicate with dfPlayer _**uart.setup(0, 9600, 8, uart.PARITY_NONE, uart.STOPBITS_1, 1)**.
UART setup can be called just once, for example in init.lua, but have in mind that this will switch also the communication and programming speed. 

Hardware connection example
===================================
A simple connection diagram follows.

Command structure
===================================
The complete serial command structure is described in the device manual (http://www.picaxe.com/docs/spe033.pdf). User Yerke was a guy who took this info a bit further by testing most of these commnads under arduino environment and posted his results here ~~ https://forum.banggood.com/forum-topic-59997.html ~~ https://web.archive.org/web/20160510212536/http://forum.banggood.com:80/forum-topic-59997.html (the original post removed from their forums)

In the current lua solution we are working is similar way with Yerke, allowing the user/developer to call the commands by using only the command and parameters (if required).

This simplifies the development of devices and projects. Developer must add a **"dofile"** command to his code in order to send the requited commnd to the dfplayer.

A simple _play_ command can be executed like this: _**dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x0d)**_ 

or a command which requires parammeters can be called like this: _**dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x0F,0x01,0x05)**_

As you can see the only thing whic needs to be set is the hex commands in _.ply( )_.

How to use
===================================
Upload the lua file (cc.lua) to your module and then from any part of your project you can call the command you like to use.

**Examples are following**  
1. **Play command:**		 				_dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x0d)_
2. **Pause command:**			 			_dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x0e)_
3. **Play file 5 on folder 1:**			_dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x0F,0x01,0x05)_
4. **Volume up:** 							_dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x04)_
5. **Volume down:** 						_dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x05)_
6. **Volume 20 (of 30 max):** 				_dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x06,0x00,0x14)_
7. **Select equalizer preset(Rock):**		_dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x07,0x00,0x02)_
8. **Play all repeat** 					_dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x11,0x00,0x01)_
9. **Stop repeat player**					_dofile("cc.lua").ply(0x11,0x00,0x00)_

Commands supported
===================================
The commands can be found on dfPlayer manual, although there are some points where the command description is not clear enough or the commands are not giving results as described.

*The following list is taken from Yerke's post on banggood forums. It contains only the a part of the commands without returned parameters. If you want more info on this visit https://forum.banggood.com/forum-topic-59997.html*

                                               played in that order and with correct track number.
                                               e.g. 0001-Joe Jackson.mp3...0348-Lets dance.mp3)

											Correction: Place ADVERT folder in the root of sd card, and this code pause mp3... play advert, and then continue playing mp3 in the same position ... 
											so if there is 3 sounds in advert folder: 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3 and 003.mp3, 
											with 19 0 3... pause mp3 file... play advert and when finished continues playing mp3
